				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p style="text-align: justify">An engine control unit (ECU) is a type of electronic control unit that determines the amount of fuel and ignition
					timing that a gasoline engine needs to keep running. <br>
					A programmable microcontroller-based ECU is designed and developed for
					<a href="http://hamidrahimi66.wix.com/iutsupermileage" target="_blank">VIVANA vehicle</a>. VIVANA is designed and manufactured by
					supermileage student design team of <a href="http://www.iut.ac.ir/en/" target="_blank">Isfahan University of Technology</a>. <br>
					This electronic control unit determines the amount of fuel, ignition timing and controls other parameters such as electronic throttle
					actuator, cooler fan, starter motor, electrical clutch and transmission system modes. It is tried to design this ECU base on
					<a href="http://www.autosar.org/" target="_blank">AUTOSAR</a> standards. <br>
					ECU's typically determine fuel injection and ignition advance time by reading values from multidimensional performance maps which are
					programmed by an interface software beforehand. <br>
					The processing unit of this ECU is an 8-bit AVR microcontroller from Atmel
					(<a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA128.aspx" target="_blank">ATMega128</a>) which has 4KB of embedded E<sup>2</sup>PROM Memory.
					ECU could be connected to PC via RS232 for uploading performance maps and monitoring real time engine information.

					<a href="http://www.nist.gov/urban-search-and-rescue-robots.cfm" target="_blank">(USAR)</a> scenarios. It is small sized, light weight
					and powerful, and has good stability and proper user interface for utilizing its capabilities. Four independent arms (also known as
					Flippers) make it able to climb stairs, ramps and many other obstacles. Using a laser range finder and SLAM algorithms, LynCean
					generates a practical map and sends it to operation site while in disaster arena. It is worth mentioning that the robot is designed
					and manufactured by the student design team of the robotic center of
					<a href="http://www.iut.ac.ir/en/" target="_blank">Isfahan University of Technology</a> and is partially funded by Isfahan Firefighting
					and Safety Services Organization (IFSO) and
					<a href="http://icti.ir/" target="_blank">Information and Communication Technology Institute (ICTI)</a>. <br>
					Controller board is an interface between embedded PC on the robot and the physical actuators and sensors. It is mainly based on four
					Atmel microcontrollers that are interconnected with I2C bus. Each of them has special tasks, classified according to data flows. The
					main parts of controller board are power management system, brushless and servo motor drivers, serial and analog interfaces for
					sensors, protection circuits and a serial interface for the connection to the embedded PC. In addition, firmware on microcontrollers
					includes fuzzy speed controller for brushless motors and data fusion algorithm for localization which is used in map generation.

					<a href="http://www.ichto.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=1028" target="_blank">Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization</a>. <br>
					This system includes high resolution displacement sensors which measure very small movements in two orthogonal axes and a wireless
					communication module to send recorded data to a data logger. The gathered information is then saved on a memory and sent to a server.
					It uses the widely-available GSM/GPRS network to send monitoring data and alerts to a number of users via FTP and SMS. Temperature and
					moisture sensors are also embedded in this system. <br>
					This module is extremely light weight and works with 2 AAA Alkaline batteries for up to 4 years. Moreover, up to 32 devices can send
					collected data to one data logger located nearby.
